## Project Proposal
### Project Objectives:
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict student outcomes, such as dropout rates and academic achievement, from publicly available education data. We aim to analyze features such as total school expenditure, teacher salary, and more to identify patterns influencing student outcomes. 
### Project Methodology:
1. Data Collection: We will source data from the following places.
    - [U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project)
   - [Colorado Education Statistics (Colorado Department of Education)](https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdereval)
   - [Education Data API](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer)
   - Additional locations as necessary
2. Data Preprocessing: We will take the following steps to preprocess the data.
   - Merge datasets
   - Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values
   - Standardize data
   - Reduce dimensionality as needed with PCA
3. Feature Exploration: We will explore the features to determine trends and predictors.
   - Create descriptive statistics like grouping by state, demographics, etc.
   - Create visualizations of data (e.g. histograms, box plots, heatmaps) 
4. Model Development and Evaluation:
   - Split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets for machine learning
   - Select and train model
### Data Sources:
Our primary data source will be the U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project dataset on Kaggle, which combines multiple U.S. education datasets into one combined dataset. Additional data will come from the Colorado Education Statistics, published by the Colorado Department of Education. 
### Project Outcomes:
We expect to develop a model that accurately predicts dropout rate and academic achievement, providing insight into the impact of factors like teacher salary and school expenditure. We will also identify which variables have the strongest influence on student outcomes.


#### Git stuff:

This sample project shows how a project in GitLab looks for demonstration purposes. It contains issues, merge requests and Markdown files in many branches,
named and filled with lorem ipsum.

You can look around to get an idea how to structure your project and, when done, you can safely delete this project.
